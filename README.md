# Architecture Portfolio → Product & UX Design

A curated collection of architectural projects demonstrating skills transferable to product and UX design: spatial problem-solving, user-centered thinking, iterative design, and visual communication.

## 🎯 About This Portfolio
This portfolio showcases my architecture work with an emphasis on competencies that translate directly to product and UX design:

- **User-Centered Design** — Designing spaces around human behavior and needs  
- **Visual Communication** — Floor plans, elevations, and diagrams as information architecture  
- **Iterative Process** — Sketches → models → renderings mirrors wireframes → prototypes → high-fidelity mockups  
- **Problem-Solving** — Balancing constraints (budget, code, site) with user experience goals

## 🚀 What's Next

I'm currently completing the **Google UX Design Professional Certificate** and developing UX-specific case studies. With foundational knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Mimo Full-Stack Certificate), I'm deepening my front-end skills through practical projects to bridge design and development. This repository will be updated with digital product design work and code-based prototypes.

Focus areas:
- UX/Product: user research, interaction design, prototyping, usability testing
- Architecture: technical drawings, spatial analysis, design communication
- Development foundations: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
