# Architecture Portfolio → UX/UI Design

A curated collection of architectural projects demonstrating skills transferable to UX/UI design: spatial problem-solving, user-centered thinking, iterative design, and visual communication.

## 🎯 About This Portfolio
This portfolio showcases my architecture work with an emphasis on competencies that translate directly to UX/UI:

- **User-Centered Design** — Designing spaces around human behavior and needs  
- **Visual Communication** — Floor plans, elevations, and diagrams as information architecture  
- **Iterative Process** — Sketches → models → renderings mirrors wireframes → prototypes → high-fidelity mockups  
- **Problem-Solving** — Balancing constraints (budget, code, site) with user experience goals
