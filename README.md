# Architecture Portfolio → Product & UX Design

A curated collection of architectural projects demonstrating skills transferable to product and UX design: spatial problem-solving, user-centered thinking, iterative design, and visual communication.

## 🎯 About This Portfolio
This portfolio showcases my architecture work with an emphasis on competencies that translate directly to product and UX design:

- **User-Centered Design** — Designing spaces around human behavior and needs  
- **Visual Communication** — Floor plans, elevations, and diagrams as information architecture  
- **Iterative Process** — Sketches → models → renderings mirrors wireframes → prototypes → high-fidelity mockups  
- **Problem-Solving** — Balancing constraints (budget, code, site) with user experience goals

## 🚀 What's Next

I recently completed the **Google UX Design Professional Certificate** and the **Mimo Full-Stack Development Certificate** and am continuing to build practical UX and front-end experience. I'm also progressing through FreeCodeCamp and actively using FreeCodeCamp projects while building UX case studies to bridge design and development.

Focus areas:
- UX/Product: user research, interaction design, prototyping, usability testing
- Architecture: technical drawings, spatial analysis, design communication
- Development foundations: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
